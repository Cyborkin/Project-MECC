Code of Conduct
Our commitment
We want Project-MECC / Honeypot Web to be an open, respectful, and safe place for everyone — contributors, maintainers, learners, and instructors. To make that possible, we ask that all participants follow this Code of Conduct.
Expected behavior
All contributors, maintainers, and participants are expected to:
Be respectful and courteous in language and tone.
Assume good faith and give others the benefit of the doubt.
Use inclusive language and avoid discriminatory or harassing remarks (race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, national origin, or political beliefs).
Report problems constructively and focus on the technical issue rather than personal criticism.
Respect the boundaries of safety and legality when using or discussing the honeypot (e.g., do not encourage illegal activity or public exposure of the honeypot).
Unacceptable behavior
The following are unacceptable and may result in removal from the project or platform:
Harassment, intimidation, or hostile language toward participants.
Discriminatory language or slurs.
Publishing private information (doxing), or encouraging others to do so.
Threats of violence or advocating illegal activity.
Repeated disruption of discussions or ignoring maintainer guidance after reasonable requests.
Pushing secrets or malware into the repository.
Reporting a violation
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:
Document the incident (dates, times, screenshots, relevant messages).
Contact the project maintainers privately:
Primary contact: Cyborkin (maintainer)
If the issue involves a security vulnerability, follow the responsible disclosure process described in CONTRIBUTING.md and mark messages as security-sensitive.
All reports will be handled with discretion. The maintainers will respond in a timely manner, investigate, and take appropriate action which may include warnings, temporary suspension, or banning from the project.
Enforcement
Enforcement actions are at the discretion of the maintainers and may include:
Private warning and request to stop the offending behavior
Temporary removal of repository access or commenting privileges
Permanent removal from project activities
Reporting to platform hosts if activity violates host Terms of Service
We commit to documenting enforcement actions internally and applying rules fairly and consistently.
Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces:
GitHub issues, pull requests, and code comments
Project mailing lists, chat channels, and collaborative documents
In-person events and workshops run under the project name
Acknowledgements
This Code of Conduct is influenced by community best practices to foster a respectful and inclusive environment. It is not exhaustive — when in doubt, choose respectful behavior and reach out to maintainers for guidance.
